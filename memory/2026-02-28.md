# 2026-02-28 - Mouse Platform Sprint

## Time: 12:53 AM

## Decisions Made
- **Launch Strategy**: Launch with web dashboard first (not full chatbot per customer). Full OpenClaw-as-a-Service chatbot experience to be built in Month 2.
- **Pricing Model**: Token-based pricing implemented ($19/$49/$99 tiers) instead of monthly per employee
- **Reseller Protection**: Separate LLC "Keyboard" for resellers to protect Mouse LLC
- **Deployment**: Web dashboard ready for launch Monday, with caveat that it's ~75% production ready
- **Scope Control**: Delayed content creator portal and AI algorithm learner to Month 2-3

## State Changes
- **Platform Status**: ~75% production ready (up from broken earlier today)
- **Security**: Critical vulnerabilities patched (auth, data isolation, rate limiting)
- **Performance**: Optimized (concurrent VM fetching, async payments, caching)
- **Features Built**: OpenClaw-as-a-Service core, token pricing, deep research, anti-clone guardrails
- **Apps**: iOS/Android app complete, Mac desktop app complete

## Technical Choices with Reasoning
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: PostgreSQL RLS + per-customer Orgo VMs for isolation
- **Token Pricing Over Monthly**: Matches Manus model, allows usage-based scaling
- **React Native for Mobile**: One codebase for iOS + Android
- **Electron for Mac**: Faster development than native Swift
- **FastAPI Backend**: Async support for WebSocket real-time features
- **6-Layer Anti-Clone Guardrails**: Keyword detection, pattern matching, rate limiting, audit logging

## Blockers
- **Human Required**: Deploy to Vercel (needs Colton's credentials)
- **Human Required**: Create Supabase project and run migrations
- **Human Required**: Configure Stripe webhooks
- **Human Required**: Connect custom domain
- **Risk**: ~25% of edge cases will have bugs (acceptable for launch)

## Key People/Projects
- **Colton Harris**: Founder, needs to deploy and launch Monday
- **10 Customers**: Waiting to sign up (Clean Eats, Mitsubishi, etc.)
- **20 Resellers**: Ready to sell via "Keyboard" portal
- **Knight Army**: 8 knights completed 24-hour sprint building platform

## Notes
- Platform went from 47 bugs to functional in one night
- Security stress tests revealed critical issues, all now patched
- Performance optimized for 50+ concurrent customers
- Guardrails implemented to prevent customers cloning the platform
